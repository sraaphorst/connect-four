# Generic Connect Four

This is a generic version of the board game, Connect Four. It is still in its
infancy, but will be written using functional programming in Kotlin with an MVC architecture.

Features to be implemented include:
1. A variable number of rows;
2. A variable number of columns;
3. A variable line length;
4. Any combination of human versus computer play, with computer play implemented using MiniMax.
5. A Mis√®re version of the game, where the goal is to avoid getting a line.
